The main objective of this project is to create a new project that helps SAP Administrators, SAP Security Administrators, and other related professionals in building an all-inclusive map of inter-SAP connections. If you want to learn more about potential SAP threats, you can visit [https://redrays.io/blog/securing-sap-server-connections-threat-modeling/|https://redrays.io/blog/securing-sap-server-connections-threat-modeling/].

The outcome of this project will be a Docker-based container that comes with a web interface. Using this interface, SAP Administrators can define credentials for SAP systems. After that, the system will establish connections with SAP systems, collect and extract relevant information about inter-SAP connections, and build a comprehensive map of SAP systems. 

The objective is to identify PROD systems that are connected to non-production SAP systems, such as test, QA, and dev, which is prohibited by SAP compliance.

### Road Map
The project will be completed by the end of May and released under the Open-Source license.
